# a quick personal note 
---
This Storybook was born as a demonstration for my master's defense for the M.S. in Digital Mapping from [New Maps Plus](https://newmapsplus.as.uky.edu/programs) at the [University of Kentucky](https://www.uky.edu/). You can view more of my projects at [my portfolio website](https://coxco96.github.io/), or have a look around [my Github profile](https://github.com/coxco96).

I decided last winter that I wanted to learn how to use a framework called Svelte. In the spirit of learning by doing, I decided I would code my final project using Sveltekit as the framework for the site itself--that is, for layout templates and page navigation/routing. 

Svelte felt like an impossible puzzle at first, but as I began to think in its language, my project grew into something much different than what I had initially intended. Rather than a narrative story in itself, I've created and and am optimizing building blocks for my future narrative impulses and geospatial musings.

Now that I've spent time with it, Svelte feels more like a game of sudoku--a bunch of little pieces influencing each other from all directions, offering the cozy sort of brain tease you want to have with coffee. This library, functional though nascent, is the foundation of a project I plan to continue developing in the coming months. 

This Storybook does not present full documentation. Eventually, that will live in the [Github repo](https://github.com/coxco96/mapbox-svelte-components). For now, the Storybook is a basic explanation of what it is and what it does, leaving out a lot of the technical intricacies happening under the hood.

It was a bit out of left field that I ever started the New Maps Plus program, and an even wider stretch to be finishing with a degree, because when I began the certificate program in April 2021, I had a bachelor's in creative writing, had never written a line of code, and knew next to nothing about maps. I'm still not sure what enticed me about the program enough to decide to pay the tuition out-of-pocket with a dwindling temp job (at the time), but I am better because I did, and I continue to become a better version of myself as I learn to see see in patterns, think in logic, recognize harm veiled by data, and advocate for myself and the world through maps. Thanks, NMP.
