  **This page assumes you've read the 'what is this?' section.**

So what are you looking at here? What's going on in the sidebar? Here's what you need to know.

**MapContainer** has three child components: 
  - **Map**
  - **Geocoder**
  - **SourceLayer**


**MapContainer** accepts props for the whole family and passes them down accordingly, which makes the map things happen.

This Storybook is laid out by **child component > prop > examples**, so you can better see what is happening and how.

For example, find the **Geocoder** heading in the sidebar. (But don't click it yet. Stay with me.)

You should see:

- **Geocoder**
  - **addGeocoder**

  - **geocoderOpts**

  - **geoprocess**

And, look now, but if you click on those subheadings, it will take you to some examples.

**Geocoder** is the child component of **MapContainer**. It's nested inside of it, like this:

```
<MapContainer>
  <Geocoder/>
<MapContainer/>
```
**addGeocoder, geocoderOpts, and geoprocess** are the **props** that **Geocoder** eventually receives, but we just send them in through **MapContainer**, because remember, you don't even *really* need to know about the child (**Geocoder**).

So let's say I want to add a geocoder to my map. Here's what that looks like:

```
<MapContainer geocoder={true}/>
```

If you don't want a geocoder, you don't need to do anything, because the default value is false.

Now, **Map** receives **mapOpts** as a prop, which does a lot to style your map. Let's say you want a geocoder *and* you want to set the zoom level to 17 (very close up).

```
<MapContainer geocoder={true} mapOpts={{zoom: 17}}/>
```

And boom, geocoder added, map zoomed in right on a house.

More thorough documentation is to come on all prop options in the **[Github repo](https://github.com/coxco96/mapbox-svelte-components)**, but that's the gist of it.

I've kept the maps for this demonstration relatively simple to clearly show what is happening here, but know that the **mapScript** prop offers full customization to the Map object by allowing you to pass in a custom function. Similarly, the **geoprocess** prop allows you to run a custom function each time the geocoder is fired. (So for example, you might write a **geoprocess** function that takes the geocoder result coordinate and animates a line from that point to the nearest ice cream shop.)

I recommend going through this from top to bottom, starting with **Map: mapOpts** and working your way down. There's a bit more information about some of what's happening and the customization options in **Utils** at the bottom.
