I'm still not sure what enticed me about the program enough to decide to pay the tuition out-of-pocket with a dwindling temp job (at the time), but I am better because I did, and I continue to become a better version of myself as I learn to see see in patterns, think in logic, recognize harm veiled by data, and advocate for myself and my world through maps.
